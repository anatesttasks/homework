# How to run acceptance tests locally
___

### RUN FROM INTELLIJ IDEA
All tests:  
CukesRunner class allows to execute all tests directly via jUnit runner. It's present in every testing project, both web and api tests.

For running features one by one or by scenario (without CukesRunner), the glue must be defined as follows:  
> _Edit Configurations (Run/Debug Configurations) --> Default --> Cucumber java â€”> Glue_  
>  _`src/test/groovy/steps/`_  
   _`src/test/groovy/env/`_  

Web tests by default are executed with Chrome browser.
